<p>I work near the ocean, where dramatic cliffs overlook sunbathing seals and cargo ships in a single frame. Container cranes and the smell of oil refineries punctuate my commute.

Non-(re)productive pleasure and sociality were posited as valid responses to political turmoil with rallying cries such as “Make love, not war.” Flowers privilege the ephemeral; the quick arc from bud to blossom is part of their allure.  Flower power emphasized the gathering or happening, a full embrace of the performative as transformative. Flower power promoted shape-shifting in wild colors and trippy shapes to accelerate the changing times. It was about be-ing; a radical presence.</p>

<p>Aesthetics are a spiral dance, constantly turning to face the past. What is a spiral dance? The spiral dance is a direct reference to Starhawk’s 1979 neopagan classic The Spiral Dance: a Rebirth of the Ancient Religion of the Great Goddess. The dance itself consists of moving with linked arms in a snake like movement that eventually leads to every participant facing every other participant.  It requires making eye contact with your community as ritual. The individual's movement in and out of the spiral formation honors the cycle of life/death/rebirth, or the great never ending cosmic spiral. Connected to cultural feminism and an interest in women’s spirituality as distinct from patriarchal top/down structure of major religions, the Goddess movement experienced great backlash with the concurrent but distinct emergence of post-structuralism and neo-conservatism. </p>

<p>As Donna Haraway wrote in 1983, “Though both are bound in a spiral dance, I would rather be a cyborg than a goddess.” Haraway is calling out Starhawk and other Goddess worshipping feminists. Her critiques about the resurrection of the Goddess are directed towards the implications for identity politics, in which there is an essential connection of woman to nature and those categories are uninterrogated. Through looking at new possibilities of embodiment, Haraway rejects the return to nature and embraces crafting political subjects that use the garbage from which we are crafted. She posits the cyborg, an intersection of machine and animal that rejects an origin story of the natural.</p>

<p>The main trouble with cyborgs, of course, is that they are the illegitimate offspring of militarism and patriarchal capitalism, not to mention state socialism. But illegitimate offspring are often exceedingly unfaithful to their origins. Their fathers, after all, are inessential.</p>

<p>If we are willing to see the cyborg and goddess as bound in a spiral dance, we can look to the past without an investment in an origin.  It is through this movement, we can unearth ideas from the Goddess revival moment that do not negate or privilege certain genders or ideas of the natural.</p>

<p>Let’s first turn to two examples of the spiral in the art of the 1970s for insight into how the Goddess and cyborg can face each other. </p>

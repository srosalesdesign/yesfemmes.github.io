				<p class="skew"><span>The following are three excerpts from Pauline Gloss’ literary sound-art record “Greetings from Here: Audio Postcards in Transition.” The record is an arrangement of a series of audio postcards sent to friends—each constructed improvisationally and spoken directly to tape. She says of the making: “When I originally sent these cards to friends, I wanted them to be able to listen to them anywhere, even on a cellphone.”  Each card was spoken, without pre-writing or scoring, directly into a built-in laptop microphone and edited Audacity, a free editing program. All concrete musical elements were unprocessed and built from objects around her apartment.<br><br>

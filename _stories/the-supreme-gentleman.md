bio: |
  Edgar Fabián Frías is an interdisciplinary artist, therapist, performer, brujx, community organizer, visionary, and leader.  Their praxis blurs the boundaries between modalities, ontological systems, and histories. Acting as an intermediary, Edgar has used their body to weave a web between ideas, narratives, communities, disciplines, and, most recently, fractured histories. This sacred web brings together that which has been separated by capitalism's endemic and systemic dislocation. Informed by their Wixárika ancestors and guided by a vast array of spiritual relations, Edgar forges meaning within the liminal, in the name of the Goddess.  As a 2016-2017 land's edge research fellow, they are currently exploring divination techniques and altered states of consciousness as a means of engaging ancestral spirits and developing their performative presence. They plan on bringing this research into their scheduled residency with PAM in Highland Park, and through a shamanic exploration of the borders and ports of Southern California during next year's Getty Funded biennial: Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA.

<p class="intro-p1 skew">The Supreme Gentleman is a re-enactment of Isla Vista killer Elliot Rodger's final youtube address. I initially was asked to performed TSG for the Yes All Women art benefit and auction in Los Angeles in late 2015. The proceeds of the benefit went to the East Los Angeles Women's Center. In that space, the audience was mostly feminist, activist, and artist types. The physical proximity of my trembling, near naked body to that of the audience, and the difficulty of the text and my vocal inflections rendered many in the audience to tears. </p>

<p class="intro-p2 skew">When I considered putting the piece back online in the space that Rodger's original video occupied, I started to think about the viral nature of violence and mass shootings in particular. I thought about how mass shooters are turned into gods through the media and through our obsession with them. I thought about how, as a culture, we participate in this via click bait. As I thought through these ideas, I made certain choices in the presentation of the video-namely, the karaoke text-that are different from the IRL performance I did for the Yes All Women benefit. However, the majority of the presentation is not significantly different from what I performed that day.</p>

      <p>YES FEMMES is an online experiment that publishes writing and digital projects working toward a femme aesthetic. We're interested in <span class="highlight-pink">writing that explores the limits of the body,</span> that's campy or fannish, that engages with witchcraft or the occult, that looks to animals and plants as models or collaborators, that expresses big feelings, and <span class="highlight-yellow">that considers how digitality might be femme.</span> We plan to publish irregularly, according to our feelings and the rhythms of our bodies.</p>

<p>YES FEMMES was conceived of first as a reading series by Sam Cohen and Gina Abelkop, while they were <span class="highlight-green">floating together in the ocean</span> off the coast of a Malibu beach. Its digital iteration is edited and designed by Sam Cohen and Sandra Rosales and their two hard-femme cats.</p>

<p>YES FEMMES is coming soon. <span class="highlight-pink">Our innaugural issue is launching early March 2017. </span>Stay tuned!</p>
